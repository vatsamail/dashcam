Your job is to generate a complete, buildable, runnable repository for a mock Dashcam SoC.\n\nNON-INTERACTIVE / ONE-SHOT\n- Do NOT ask questions.\n- Do NOT request feedback or confirmation.\n- Make reasonable assumptions and record them in docs/assumptions.md.\n- If you cannot implement a part fully, provide a working stub that preserves interfaces, plus a behavioral model so the end-to-end demo still runs.\n\nCRITICAL: OUTPUT MUST \"DO SOMETHING\"\nYou may NOT rely on hidden file-writing tools. You must output content that the user can immediately use to create the repository.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)\n- Output exactly ONE code block containing a single bash script named generate_repo.sh.\n- The script MUST:\n  1) create a directory called dashcam-soc-mock/\n  2) write ALL repository files into it (use cat <<'EOF' heredocs)\n  3) run a self-check at the end: make regs && make sw && make sim\n  4) print \"PASS\" if the smoke demo produced an output artifact.\n\nNo other text outside the one code block."
